the phone staff was very helpful but i do not understand why the 'on line ' quotation for car insurance from an organisation who seek out the cheapest deals was so much cheaper than the quotation from axa themselves.

The reason I have said that they are excellent is that unfortunarely we had to use their services in April when my wife was taken into hospital while on holiday in Cyprus.As she was in hospital over our planned return date  they couldn't have been more helpful and contacted us to see what our special reqiurements were and paid all expenses including medical Billsair flights home extra hotel bills and transportation to and from airports.It goes withhout saying that when you find yourselves in situations like this it is very gratifying to know that you have the support of a good insurance company behind you.I would definately recommend this company and i have been singing their praises since we got back to the UK.
