as lv requested a 'no show' this letter was impossible to get from ryanair as they wouldn't even accept our cancellation of travel - they are impossible to deal with but lv made no allowances for this so i have been unable to make a claim

staff i called was helpful and easily cancelled the expensive renewal quote and didn't realise i probably could have just rung and got a matched quote.
renewal quote
positive
had to ring and challenge the renewal quote to get it reduced wouldn't expect to have to do this as along term customer, best price should be given to all as a standard
renewal quote
positive
i love axa, it's a great service, but my renewal quote was high and only came down to a decent price when i phoned to query it.
renewal quote
positive
my renewal quote was up 15% on the previous year and higher than i was being quoted elsewhere, but following a very helpful telephone call, the cost was reduced to less than the previous year.
renewal quote
positive
i choose axa as my renewal quote was almost double what i paid the previous year and axa was the next best quote for what i needed.
renewal quote
positive
apart from the usual ridiculous renewal quote, the process of negotiating a more reasonable cost to insure was calm, efficient and positive
renewal quote
positive
they didn't give the best renewal quote but after ringing them they did their best to sort a new quote
renewal quote
positive
when i received my renewal quote it was quite a bit more than the previous year.
renewal quote
positive
after getting a high renewal quote from my previous insurance provider, the price and level of cover was to good to miss
renewal quote
positive
very pleasant members of staff who were knowledgable and although their initial renewal quote was higher than others they were able to bring this down for me.
renewal quote
positive
the renewal quote was reasonable
renewal quote
positive
we renewed our car insurance policy as we were happy with the renewal quote

positive
i thought the renewal quote to be reasonable for what i wanted so i renewed
renewal quote
positive
for once a renewal quote was actually acceptable!
renewal quote
positive
renewal quote was cheapervthan anyone else.
renewal quote
positive
this is the first time in years a renewal quote was lower than a new quote.
renewal quote
positive
renewal quote was competitive (unlike a lot of other companies)
renewal quote
positive
nothing to it, happy with renewal quote
renewal quote
positive
have been more than happy with axa eventual renewal quote.
renewal quote
positive
reasonable renewal quote
renewal quote
positive
my renewal quote was the cheapest i could find where usually insurance renewals seem to go up as companies quote new customers cheaper.
renewal quote
positive
service was very good but each year my renewal quote is much higher than those of comparison sites.
renewal quote
positive
disappointed about the renewal quote initially but then happy with the price offered when i called to ask for the best price.
renewal quote
positive
they didn't give the best renewal quote but after ringing them they did their best to sort a new quote
renewal quote
positive
we had to deal with flood situation in our home that caused quite significant damage.
damage
positive
we dealt with three axa representatives in total - the first polite and helpful, the second (a building surveyor) inconsistent in his assessment of the risk factor attached to the state of the damage, and the third plain rude.
damage
positive
i felt as though my past custom (loyalty) was recognised.
loyalty
positive
good to see existing customers being rewarded for a big of loyalty.
loyalty
positive
axa now have my loyalty.
loyalty
positive
they didn't increase my premium more than expected, showing appreciation for my loyalty.
loyalty
positive
the whole thing is geared to rewarding new business and not loyalty.
loyalty
positive
that's how you should treat someone who shows some loyalty.
loyalty
positive
where is the gain for the loyalty of customers who renew their cover with axa?
loyalty
positive
loyalty doesn't usually count
loyalty
positive
money grabbing gits who penalize loyalty
loyalty
positive
great price insurance fantastic easy to use online service and best of all discount for loyalty!
loyalty
positive
"they actually showed me loyalty by reducing my premium, with a great service."""

benefits are getting worse.
benefits
positive
so far, vitality has just been a financial burden to me (for a service that was supposed to be a free job perk) and has offered zero medical benefit, as i ended up not having any treatment done.
benefits
positive
They move the goalposts constantly to make sure that what looks like a benefit doesn't materialise
benefits
positive
Examples are reducing the points earned for physical activity to make it harder to earn the benefit
benefits
positive
couple this with the removal of benefits like non smokers cashback, garmin discount reduced from 50% to 25% and free starbucks drink size reduction, which you can't use if starbucks is a franchise outlet, thus eliminating the vast majority in my area and the policy is not what our company signed up for originally.
benefits
positive
also the vitality benefits scheme has gone down hill it seems very difficult to get a starbucks or cinema tickets
benefits
positive
every year changes are made either reducing the benefits or increasing points required to obtain them.
benefits
positive
reducing benefits, increasing costs.
benefits
positive
more steps required to achieve goals, more people required to achieve benefits eg cinema.
benefits
positive
in sum so far, i have yielded no benefits from being a member of this scheme, on the contrary.
benefits
positive
all the benefits were good at first, they're just getting harder to achieve and constantly change it's policy all the time.
benefits
positive
continual changes and downgrading of benefits and frequent difficulty as an employer making changes to group policy
benefits
positive
where is the incentive to become gold or platinum status if you don't get any extra benefits?
benefits
positive
the benefits continually are reduced and the prices are continually increased, not a recipe for a long term relationship
benefits
positive
we are required to earn more points to benefits from rewards and on the same side efforts are rewarded less points.
benefits
positive
some high value benefits can just disappear, like non-smoker cashback of £150 a year.
benefits
positive
the product is unfortunately backed up with a less than appropriate level of customer service and the arbitrary withdrawal of benefits and increases in cost.
benefits
positive
i have been unable to access any of the vitality benefits since early 2016 because of problems with the member zone both via the internet and the app. despite making several calls during this time and sending complaint emails
benefits
positive
having been a member for 3 years, have seen an annual decline in the benefits (loss of non smoker cash back, loss of gold/platinum incentives, proposed reduced points per activity) combined with significant annual percentage increases in premiums.
benefits
positive
a lot of the benefits have ceased, smoking, nectar, national trust etc.
benefits
positive
very good health cover but some benefits limited in scotland.
benefits
positive
all good benefits removed, from a platinum member of last three years, vitality has gone down hill.
benefits
positive
i have been a member with them for 11 years and over the past few years they have consistently cut member benefits whilst ramping premiums (and i have not made a claim for 7 years).
benefits
positive
although i have been pleased with the level of cover, the erosion of benefits such as cash back is a little frustrating, as is the fact that the moves app does not work properly. despite copntacting moves on 3 occasions
benefits
positive
the additional vitality benefits provided are good, but i have been annoyed how they are continually made harder and harder to achieve, with a combination since originally joining of requiring multiple members to gain points, increase points required while lowering daily points achievable and removing automatic achievement at gold status.
benefits
positive
benefits are slowly getting less attractive, keep getting removed from the offer.
benefits
positive
had my vitality plan for over 5 years and while the extra benefits were great to start with, they reduce what they offer or make it harder to achieve these benefits each year, yet the premiums increase every year.
benefits
positive
benefits keep getting downgraded, service is ok, customer support is good, benefits are getting worse.
benefits
positive
just not worth it , list of benefits keep being reduced while the cost increases over 50%year on year.
benefits
positive
service and benefits keeps dropping-….
benefits
positive
if vitality are this slippery on member benefits, i dread to think how they'd act if i ever needed to claim for ill health.
benefits
positive
like so many things in life great when i took the policy out but they have continually chipped away at the benefits and removing the non-smokers payment was really poor.
benefits
positive
reducing benefits every year.
benefits
positive
benefits in decline, so for the first year of joining, 5* and all good.
benefits
positive
the vitality scheme is good in theory but vitality health regularly reduce the benefits of it and make it harder to reach the target point levels.
benefits
positive
i don't have the time to monitor trying to achieve the different reward levels of the policy and wish it were simpler.
reward
positive
everyone has the same issue with the rewards, especially the cinema reward.
reward
positive
the reward system is less good than before.
reward
positive
it is time a policy was tailored for the older generation who simply want peace of mind that essential in-patient treatment will be covered at an affordable premium and recognises that the other reward benefits are irrelevant.
reward
positive
then, they just removed the itunes credit reward with zero communication.
reward
positive
poor cheap stunt to save money and remove reward.
reward
positive
the rewards programme, which used to be quite attractive has been continually diluted and it is clear that when a reward becomes too popular it goes 'out of the window'.
reward
positive
ok rewards - but even then, some cannot be used at all stores eg the starbucks reward.
