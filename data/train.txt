initially the service was great but once we had finalised payment we realised we needed to ammend the policy start date from 2 weeks from the day of purchase to 1 week from day of purchase so both daes were before any cover had started and online we were prompted that we couldnt change his but to call up and they could do i but once we called up they said no they cant and that we needed to do whole new policy paying twice in total and then cancel the first one leaving us nearly Â£200 down waiting on a refund for a week for the sake of anadministrative change very poor control over there own systems we still havent had confirmation of the refund

Quick easy and competitive l have used axa before with no problems however as customer loyalty is not reflected in renewal quotes l will no doubt be changing companies next year and whilst most renewals are drastically reduced when you telephone the companies/brokers it is as a matter of principle that l take my custom somewhere else given that nowadays it only takes a few clicks and very little time to compare most companies l live in hope that one day customer loyalty will enter the world of insurance how amazing would it be to have a premium based on your past history

So I used a well known comparison site and came across an AXA quote and by buying EU breakdown cover direct I was able to not only save Â£253 over the renewal terms for the same covers but my excess had dropped from Â£550 to Â£250.

it reduced further for the following day (though not by much) this makes no sense to me and my opinion is that a quotation ought to be valid from the day quoted and for a specified period not variable according to the day of the week or month you require it.

You sent me a renewal letter with a wrong date 1 day after expiry and thanks to you I drove 1 day without insurance and I made a phone call to renew the policy and the lady told me there was an error in the system and I was no longer insured and because of that I could not renew the policy and I would had to get a new quotation which after 15 minutes I have been told it is going to take another 10 minutes to finish the processes I really I wish I had an accident that day 3rd of September  just to take you to court for not being insured by AXA insurance mistake as I am pretty sure I would won the case and that lady on the phone she should have offered the extra day for free.
